===== Introduction =====

This RFC proposes that the PHP project should adopt a formal code of conduct for its members.

The goal of this code of conduct is to give a clear signal what is expected of contributors and project maintainers, regarding their conduct in discussions on mailing lists, and other related communication channels. More specifically, the expected conduct in discussing language improvements and changes through the RFC process.

This proposal consists of several parts:

  * A general "Code of Conduct", which provides a general overview on what is expected and unacceptable behaviour.
  * A set of guidelines to foster collaboration and productive discussion.
  * A Community Mediation Team to assess and act upon the complaints as received through the above procedures.
  * A set of procedures to follow if individuals wish to make complaints if other project members behave in abusive or destructive way, or in case of conflict which can not be resolved by participants themselves.
  * Possibilities for strong action if mediation and moderation attempts by the Community Mediation Team has proven unsuccessful, and abusive or destructive behavior continues. 

===== Proposal =====

==== Code of Conduct ====

This RFC proposes to adopt the following text as the PHP code of conduct:

=== Code of Conduct Text ===

PHP is a project developed and maintained by the PHP community, which is composed of a wide and diverse set of individuals. As the community, we commit to working together in order to create the best experience for our users and to make our community successful, growing and welcoming. With that goal in mind, we encourage members of our community to follow a set of guidelines:

* Be respectful. 
As a vibrant developer community and a project having a large user base, we deal with wide range of skills, experiences, approaches and opinions. Disagreement and lively discussion are not uncommon, but we all united by the common goals and even in the heat of disagreement, we keep that in mind and treat each other with respect. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. Remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. 
We commit to and expect respectful behavior when dealing with other members of the project and with wider user community.

* Assume good faith. 
The diversity of our community means interaction of people with different opinions, cultural backgrounds and personal styles. Misunderstandings and mistakes can happen. Try to resolve them before they escalate into conflict, and do not presume malice when there may be none. Assuming good faith does not preclude discussion and ciritcism, and does not excuse bad behavior when there is an evidence of it.
When disagreeing, we try to understand the source of disagreement with the presumption of good faith from all participants. Even with difference of opinions, trying to understand other's view may foster a way for a consensual solution. 

* Be considerate. 
Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and we should take those consequences into account when making decisions. 
We are a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language. Be are careful of how we express yourself and if you suspect something you say may be taken in a wrong way or be hurtful to someone, consider rephrasing it or omitting the questional language altogether. It is better to be descriptive than to be concise.
Think before you click "reply". Consider how the other party is likely to feel with the content. And, how you would feel if the same text was directed at you. Emotions are important and difficult, especially when you have never met in person.

* Be patient. 
We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack or behavior destructive to the project and the community. We discuss in a manner that makes for other participnts easier to achieve a consensus and find the best solution. 
Do not "rapid-fire" reply to an active or controversial topic, but instead take the time to compose and edit the reply containing all the information you wanted to convey. Don't use hyperbole and far-reaching analogies appealing to controversial or emotional subjects to defend your arguments.

* Be helpful and kind. 
We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. As a language with a low entry barrier, we deal with users of very varied backgrounds and levels of experience. As a professional community, we always behave in a professional way and never insult or put down other project members or users outside PHP developer community. We make effort to help our users and other developers to achieve their goals and be successful. 
When disagreeing, provide substantial reason instead of just saying "no". Try to outline specific points you disagree with and suggest ways of improvement. And remember, you can suggest improvements to a proposal even if you would not vote to support the proposal, and help people even if you disagree with them in some aspects or questions.
Be tolerant to honest mistakes - donâ€™t forget that it is human to err and focusing on blame and guilt is not productive. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of their background, personal or group identity. We do not tolerate destructive and hurtful behaviors, including such behaviors as:

  * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  * The inappropriate use of sexualized language or imagery.
  * Personal attacks and insults.
  * Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments.
  * Public or private harassment.
  * Publishing other's private information, without explicit permission.

We expect all participants of the project to avoid such behaviors and to not tolerate or encourage them in others.
We will reject any contributions exhibiting such behaviors or being inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. 
We commit to to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project and to every project space, including source code, documentation, discussion lists, wikis and other project venues.

In order to facilitate collaboration, avoid conflict and resolve disagreements, 
we have a dedicated Community Mediation Team. This team accepts reports, facilitates conflict resolution and takes actions to ensure the fullfillment of our commitments as listed above. The exact details of the team membership and procedures are described separately.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may
be reported by contacting the Community Mediation Team at codeofconduct@php.net. 
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will
result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the
circumstances. Team members are obligated to maintain confidentiality
with regard to the reporter of an incident and incident details, within the rules of the team.

We encourage and expect the members of the project to to first try to resolve conflicts between themselves in a constructive manner, asking for help when needed. If that fails, we escalate the matter to the Community Mediation Team which provides a process and tools for resolving the conflict and preventing it from disrupting the collaboration on the project.

=== Website Page ===

A page will be created on php.net at //php.net/codeofconduct// that will display the actual language of the code of conduct used above.

=== Website Page ===

A page will be created on php.net at //php.net/collaboration-guidelines// that will display the collaboration guidelines as described above.

==== Complaints procedure ====

=== Mailing List ===

A new mailing list will be created at //codeofconduct@php.net// for use in reporting incidents and discussing them internally. This mailing list will be private.

=== Process For Reported Incidents ===

In the event that an incident is reported the following process should be followed:

  * The Community Mediation Team is notified of an incident through //codeofconduct@php.net//
  * The Community Mediation Team should pick a case handler to deal with each specific incident
  * A team member shall document the issue as thoroughly as possible, researching any supporting materials necessary
  * A team member shall make contact with the accused transgressing party and document their side as much as possible
  * A team member shall make every reasonable attempt to mediate and defuse the situation without needing to resort to taking action against the accused

If all reasonable efforts to reach a mediated agreement fail and other action is deemed absolutely necessary as a last resort:

  * The team member makes a recommended course-of-action to the Community Mediation Team
  * The Community Mediation Team will vote internally on the recommended course-of-action (4/5 majority required to affect any action)
  * The Community Mediation Team shall report a redacted summary of the incident and the course-of-action to //internals@php.net//

At all steps the reporter(s) should be kept up to date on the process and recommendations that are made.

During the investigation the reporter(s) should respect the Community Mediation Team's workings, and the privacy of the accused offending party. For example, there should be no public shaming of the accused offending party, nor of the Community Mediation Team's way of handling things before a conclusion by the team is reached.

=== Confidentiality ===

All incidents are to be kept in the strictest form of confidentiality. The Community Mediation Team shall be the only group to know about the reporter and the precise details of any incident. Any communication outside of the team (including fact-finding, investigation, documentation, etc.) shall not include identifying information as to the reporter unless agreed by the reporter or is otherwise public.

Additionally, reasonable attempts shall be made as to the confidentiality to the accused person. This includes transparency reports where no significant action is taken (due to lack of evidence or that the Community Mediation Team determines it wasn't significant enough to warrant action against the accused).


=== Reasonable Person Test ===

To determine if the incident is a violation or not, the Community Mediation Team shall use the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_person|Reasonable Person Test]]. 

The following four points shall be taken into account for any incident:

  * the foreseeable risk of harm their actions create versus the utility of their actions
  * the extent of the risk so created
  * the likelihood such risk will actually cause harm to others
  * any alternatives of lesser risk, and the costs of those alternatives

Additionally, it shall be assumed that both parties (the accuser and the accused) are acting as reasonable people until proven otherwise. This means that best intentions shall be assumed unless significant evidence to the contrary is found.

Note: reporting an incident does not absolve a person of the requirement to abide by the Code of Conduct. This means that the victim of harassment is not entitled to "harass back". 


==== Community Mediation Team ====

A team of 5 volunteers shall be assembled who will make up the Community Mediation Team.

The team shall consist of:

  * At least one person with commit karma to php-src
  * At least one person **without** any karma to php-src
  * At least one person with commit karma to php-documentation

As long as the preceding three seats are filled, by three different people, there is no karma requirement (wiki or otherwise) for the remaining two seats.

All team members will be elected by RFC vote (requiring 2/3 majority). 

There is no specified term limit, but if either the PHP project or the other members of the Community Mediation Team feel that a specific member is not doing their job, they can be removed by an RFC vote (requiring 50% + 1 to support removal).

=== Transparency ===

Any action taken by the Community Mediation Team shall be reported to internals@php.net, including a summary of the incident and the action taken. The summary of the incident should include supporting evidence and justification for the decision.

Reasonable efforts should be taken to ensure the privacy of the reporting party. The only two exceptions are if the incident was public or if the reporting party agrees to be identified. 

Additionally, once per quarter (every 3 months), the Community Mediation Team shall produce an aggregated report as to the number of times incidents were reported, and the outcomes of the incidents, even if no action was taken.

==== Potential Actions ====

The intention is that nothing in this section will ever be needed. In extreme cases, when the Community Mediation Team finds that a certain project member continues to violate either the Code of Conduct or Constructive Contributing Guidelines, more action **might** be required.

The Community Mediation Team should make every reasonable attempt to defuse the situation without having to resort to action against the accused. This includes establishing a meaningful discussion around the incident, giving the accused transgresser the chance to apologize (privately or publicly, depending on the incident) or determining that no action is necessary even if the Code of Conduct was violated.

In the event that action is required, it may include:

  * Reverting or editing existing commits
  * Rejecting pull requests
  * Reverting or rejecting wiki edits, issues and other contributions
  * Issuing a temporary ban (no more than 7 days)

If the Community Mediation Team (with 4/5th majority as described above) determines that additional action is required, an RFC to the general project is created. Once the RFC is issued, the original temporary ban's lifetime will be tied to the RFC's lifetime (will expire when the vote is finished). All additional action RFCs will require 2/3 majority to affect the ban. However, the original temporary ban shall not include the //internals@php.net// mailing list, provided that the accused party remains civil and reasonably within the Code of Conduct to ensure that they receive a fair representation during the ban discussion.

Additional action may include removal of commit karma, mailing list write access as well as disabling of the associated PHP.net account. Depending on the particular infraction, one, many or all access may be suspended.

A new address/account which is believed to be used by an already banned individual does not require a RFC to effect provided there is reasonable evidence to support the correlation.

Bans (temporary or permanent) should only be used in egregious cases where a pattern of disregard for the Code of Conduct is demonstrated.

=== Appeals ===

Either party may appeal an action by raising the concern to internals@php.net. PHP project members may then vote to overturn or strengthen the action as necessary (votes require 50%+1 to overturn, and 2/3 majority to strengthen the action).

It is worth noting that this may be used as a technique to attempt to disclose the reporter to make them the subject of public scrutiny. Therefore reasonable attempts at confidentiality should be maintained, and the teams (Community Mediation Team and PHP project members) should keep this in mind. 

==== Additional Sections ====

=== Conflict of Interest ===

In the event that a Code of Conduct violation is reported against a Community Mediation Team member, the remaining members shall investigate and raise the concern to internals@php.net, even if they determine no action is to be taken. 

=== Accountability ===

The PHP project voting body has the right to overturn any action taken the Community Mediation Team by vote (50% + 1 required to overturn).

=== Updating Code Of Conduct ===

Any changes to the text of the Code of Conduct, or updating the version of it shall require an RFC with 2/3 majority voting. Any changes to the text of the Contributor Guidelines shall require an RFC with 2/3 majority voting.


===== Examples =====

==== "Representing The Project" ====

=== Activities on a php.net property ===

Activities on a php.net property shall always be considered "representing the project" and hence fall under the jurisdiction of the Code of Conduct and Community Mediation Team. This includes any php.net mailing list. 

=== Activities at a technology conference ===

While at a technology conference, the Code of Conduct is only considered to apply if and only if the person is demonstrably representing the project.

For example, merely speaking at a conference about PHP is not enough to be "representing the project". However, when speaking about the project itself (meaning internals functions, etc), while the talk is occurring the Code of Conduct shall apply.

This is not intended to limit the applicability of the Code of Conduct solely to the duration of the talk, however any violation that happens at a conference shall be assumed to **not** be representing the project unless there is significant and obvious evidence to the contrary.

=== Activities on a social network ===

On social networks, the Code of Conduct is only considered to apply if the context of the conversation makes it clear that the person represents the PHP project.

For example, merely having "PHP contributor" in an about or bio is not enough to be "representing the project". However, a conversation about the PHP project itself (including RFCs, etc) is enough to justify "representation".

=== Other ===

In all cases, if an issue seems reasonably connected to a project matter, the Code of Conduct may apply depending on how strongly the connection is.

For example, if one person is involved in a heated discussion on internals@, and then immediately after starts harassing another participant on another channel with similar tone, the harassment may be considered a violation.

In no case should a casual connection be considered a violation (just because two people are both members of the project is not enough to form a connection).


===== Initial Community Mediation Team =====

This RFC will include a vote for the initial Community Mediation Team. A separate thread will be opened asking for volunteers. 

===== Vote =====

This RFC requires 2/3 majority to pass, as it has a significant impact on the community and project operations.
