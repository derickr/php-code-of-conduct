Procedures
==========

A new mailing list will be created at //codeofconduct@php.net// for use in
reporting incidents and discussing them internally. This mailing list will be
private.

Process For Reported Incidents
------------------------------

In the event that an incident is reported the following process should be
followed:

* The Community Mediation Team is notified of an incident through //codeofconduct@php.net//
* The Community Mediation Team should pick a case handler to deal with each specific incident
* A team member shall document the issue as thoroughly as possible, researching any supporting materials necessary
* A team member shall make contact with the accused transgressing party and document their side as much as possible
* A team member shall make every reasonable attempt to mediate and defuse the situation without needing to resort to taking action against the accused

If all reasonable efforts to reach a mediated agreement fail and other action
is deemed absolutely necessary as a last resort:

* The team member makes a recommended course-of-action to the Community Mediation Team
* The Community Mediation Team will vote internally on the recommended course-of-action (4/5 majority required to affect any action)
* The Community Mediation Team shall report a redacted summary of the incident and the course-of-action to //internals@php.net//

At all steps the reporter(s) should be kept up to date on the process and
recommendations that are made.

During the investigation the reporter(s) should respect the Community
Mediation Team's workings, and the privacy of the accused offending party. For
example, there should be no public shaming of the accused offending party, nor
of the Community Mediation Team's way of handling things before a conclusion
by the team is reached.

Confidentiality
---------------

All incidents are to be kept in the strictest form of confidentiality. The
Community Mediation Team shall be the only group to know about the reporter
and the precise details of any incident. Any communication outside of the team
(including fact-finding, investigation, documentation, etc.) shall not include
identifying information as to the reporter unless agreed by the reporter or is
otherwise public.

Additionally, reasonable attempts shall be made as to the confidentiality to
the accused person. This includes transparency reports where no significant
action is taken (due to lack of evidence or that the Community Mediation Team
determines it wasn't significant enough to warrant action against the
accused).


Reasonable Person Test
----------------------

To determine if the incident is a violation or not, the Community Mediation
Team shall use the `Reasonable Person Test`_.

.. _`Reasonable Person Test`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_person

The following four points shall be taken into account for any incident:

* the foreseeable risk of harm their actions create versus the utility of their actions
* the extent of the risk so created
* the likelihood such risk will actually cause harm to others
* any alternatives of lesser risk, and the costs of those alternatives

Additionally, it shall be assumed that both parties (the accuser and the
accused) are acting as reasonable people until proven otherwise. This means
that best intentions shall be assumed unless significant evidence to the
contrary is found.

Note: reporting an incident does not absolve a person of the requirement to
abide by the Code of Conduct. This means that the victim of harassment is not
entitled to "harass back".
