Community Mediation Team
========================

A team of 5 volunteers shall be assembled who will make up the Community
Mediation Team.

The team shall consist of:

* At least one person with commit karma to php-src
* At least one person **without** any karma to php-src
* At least one person with commit karma to php-documentation

As long as the preceding three seats are filled, by three different people,
there is no karma requirement (wiki or otherwise) for the remaining two seats.

All team members will be elected by RFC vote (requiring 2/3 majority). 

There is no specified term limit, but if either the PHP project or the other
members of the Community Mediation Team feel that a specific member is not
doing their job, they can be removed by an RFC vote (requiring 50% + 1 to
support removal).

Transparency
------------

Any action taken by the Community Mediation Team shall be reported to
internals@php.net, including a summary of the incident and the action taken.
The summary of the incident should include supporting evidence and
justification for the decision.

Additionally, once per quarter (every 3 months), the Community Mediation Team
shall produce an aggregated report as to the number of times incidents were
reported, and the outcomes of the incidents, even if no action was taken.

Potential Actions
-----------------

The intention is that nothing in this section will ever be needed. In extreme
cases, when the Community Mediation Team finds that a certain project member
continues to violate either the Code of Conduct or Constructive Contributing
Guidelines, more action **might** be required.

The Community Mediation Team should make every reasonable attempt to defuse
the situation without having to resort to action against the accused. This
includes establishing a meaningful discussion around the incident, giving the
accused transgresser the chance to apologize (privately or publicly, depending
on the incident) or determining that no action is necessary even if the Code
of Conduct was violated.

In the event that action is required, it may include:

* Reverting or editing existing commits
* Rejecting pull requests
* Reverting or rejecting wiki edits, issues and other contributions
* Issuing a temporary ban (no more than 7 days)

If the Community Mediation Team (with 4/5th majority as described above)
determines that additional action is required, an RFC to the general project
is created. Once the RFC is issued, the original temporary ban's lifetime will
be tied to the RFC's lifetime (will expire when the vote is finished). All
additional action RFCs will require 2/3 majority to affect the ban. However,
the original temporary ban shall not include the //internals@php.net// mailing
list, provided that the accused party remains civil and reasonably within the
Code of Conduct to ensure that they receive a fair representation during the
ban discussion.

Additional action may include removal of commit karma, mailing list write
access as well as disabling of the associated PHP.net account. Depending on
the particular infraction, one, many or all access may be suspended.

A new address/account which is believed to be used by an already banned
individual does not require a RFC to effect provided there is reasonable
evidence to support the correlation.

Bans (temporary or permanent) should only be used in egregious cases where a
pattern of disregard for the Code of Conduct is demonstrated.

Appeals
-------

Either party may appeal an action by raising the concern to internals@php.net.
PHP project members may then vote to overturn or strengthen the action as
necessary (votes require 50%+1 to overturn, and 2/3 majority to strengthen the
action).

It is worth noting that this may be used as a technique to attempt to disclose
the reporter to make them the subject of public scrutiny. Therefore reasonable
attempts at confidentiality should be maintained, and the teams (Community
Mediation Team and PHP project members) should keep this in mind. 

Conflict of Interest
--------------------

In the event that a Code of Conduct violation is reported against a Community
Mediation Team member, the remaining members shall investigate and raise the
concern to internals@php.net, even if they determine no action is to be taken. 

Accountability
--------------

The PHP project voting body has the right to overturn any action taken the
Community Mediation Team by vote (50% + 1 required to overturn).

Initial Community Mediation Team
--------------------------------

This RFC will include a vote for the initial Community Mediation Team. A
separate thread will be opened asking for volunteers.
